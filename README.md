🚀# **Overview and Basic Requirements for Deploying ClickHouse and Superset on Kubernetes**

## **Overview**
Deploying ClickHouse and Superset on Kubernetes involves setting up persistent storage, configuring services, and ensuring connectivity between the two applications. This guide provides steps to achieve this using Helm charts for deployment and Docker Desktop for the Kubernetes environment.

## **Basic Requirements**
1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Running on Docker Desktop. 🐳
2. **Helm**: Installed for managing Kubernetes applications. ⎈
3. **Persistent Storage**: At least 10Gi for ClickHouse. 💾
4. **Superset and ClickHouse Docker Images**: Available in the Helm repository. 🐋

## **Steps to Deploy ClickHouse and Superset** 🚀

1. **Add Helm Repositories** 📦
   - Add the required Helm repositories for ClickHouse and Superset.

2. **Install ClickHouse with Persistent Storage** 🏠
   - Install ClickHouse using Helm with persistence enabled and a storage size of 10Gi.
   - Ensure the native port 9000 is exposed.

3. **Deploy Superset** 🚀
   - Install Superset using Helm.
   - Configure persistence with 10Gi storage.
   - Set the service type to LoadBalancer.
   - Configure PostgreSQL password and enable Redis.

4. **Access Superset UI** 🌐
   - Forward the Superset service to port 9000 on localhost.

5. **Connect ClickHouse to Superset** 🔗
   - Open Superset UI in a browser at `localhost:9000`.
   - Navigate to `Data > Databases`.
   - Click the `+Database` button and choose ClickHouse from the list.
   - Add the ClickHouse URL and click connect.

## **Additional Considerations** 📋
- Ensure there are no conflicts with existing services or resources.
- Verify all pods and services are running correctly before accessing the Superset UI.
- Handle any errors related to resource ownership or configuration annotations.
