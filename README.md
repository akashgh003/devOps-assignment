# <span style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">🚀Overview and Basic Requirements for Deploying ClickHouse and Superset on Kubernetes</span>

## **Overview**
Deploying ClickHouse and Superset on Kubernetes involves setting up persistent storage, configuring services, and ensuring connectivity between the two applications. This guide provides steps to achieve this using Minikube for local Kubernetes environment management.

## **Basic Requirements**
1. **Minikube**: Installed for local Kubernetes cluster management. 🚀
2. **ClickHouse**: 
   - Deploy ClickHouse with persistent storage of at least 10Gi. 💾
   - Expose necessary ports for internal communication.
3. **Superset and ClickHouse Docker Images**: Available in Helm charts or repositories. 🐋

## **Steps to Deploy ClickHouse and Superset** 🚀

1. **Install ClickHouse with Persistent Storage** 🏠
   - Deploy ClickHouse StatefulSet with persistent volume claims (PVCs) for data storage.
   - Expose necessary ports for internal communication.

2. **Deploy Superset** 🚀
   - Deploy Superset using Helm or Kubernetes manifests.
   - Configure persistence with 10Gi storage for metadata and data caching.
   - Expose Superset UI using a LoadBalancer service type.

3. **Access Superset UI** 🌐
   - Forward the Superset service to a local port using `kubectl port-forward`.
   - Access Superset UI via `localhost` and the assigned port.

4. **Connect ClickHouse to Superset** 🔗
   - Open Superset UI in a browser.
   - Configure ClickHouse database connection details in Superset.
   - Verify connection and functionality.

## **Additional Considerations** 📋
- Ensure Minikube resources are sufficient for running ClickHouse and Superset.
- Handle any Kubernetes resource conflicts or ownership issues during deployment.
- Monitor pod statuses and service availability using `kubectl`.
